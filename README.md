It _provides_:

* a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) to analyze and visualize the empirical performance of IOHs,
* interactive plotting,
* statistical evaluation,
* report generation, and
* a command-line interface (CLI) for the `R` console allowing for fine-grained controls.  

It is _built mainly on_:

* `R` packages [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) and [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/).
<!-- * [scmacp](https://github.com/b0rxa/scmamp) package for Bayesian analysis. -->

It is _available through_:

* a free [online service](#server) that you can use right away, or
* the local [installation](#install) of the package.

## <a name="server"></a>Online Service

A free server [http://iohprofiler.liacs.nl](http://iohprofiler.liacs.nl) running the stable version of __IOHanalyzer__ is hosted in [Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science](https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/). You're welcome to check it out!

## <a name="install"></a>Installation

### Software dependency

* [mandatory] `R` As __IOHanalyzer__ is written as a `R` package, the `R` environment has to be installed first. The binary file and installation manual for R can be found here [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/).
* [optional] `orca` required to download plotly figures. Please see [https://github.com/plotly/orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca) for the installation instruction.

### Stable version

Please start up an `R` console and install the stable version as:

```r
R> install.packages('IOHanalyzer')
```

which is maintained on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=IOHanalyzer) (Comprehensive R Archive Network).

### Lastest version

The lastest development is always hosted on Github. In case you'd like to try out this version, the `R` package **devtool** is needed:

```r
R> install.packages('devtools')
R> devtools::install_github('IOHprofiler/IOHanalyzer')
```

### Development version

If you want to run the version on which you develop:

```r
R> devtools::install_git("/path/to/your/IOHanalyzer/git/repo")
```

## <a name="run"></a>Runinng the Web Interface locally

The IOHanalyzer package can be loaded using the following commands:

```r
R> library('IOHanalyzer')
R> runServer()
```

It should open a browser on the `localhost` server, using a random port number. Of course, you
could also specify the port number directly:

```r
R> runServer(port = 1234)
```

Have fun! For the complete reference on usage, please check out our [Wiki page](https://iohprofiler.github.io/).

## Host it online

We provide a docker file for deploying __IOHanalyzer__ on the server. Please see [https://github.com/IOHprofiler/IOHanalyzer-docker](https://github.com/IOHprofiler/IOHanalyzer-docker) for details.

## Supported Data Format

Specific formats are required to load your benchmark data to **IOHanalyzer**. If your data sets are generated in the format of

* **COCO/BBOB** data format as regulated in [https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00362649](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00362649),
* **Nevergrad** data format (explained in [https://github.com/facebookresearch/nevergrad](https://github.com/facebookresearch/nevergrad)), or
* **IOHprofiler** data format, which is motivated and modified from **COCO** data format,

then you just need to compress the data folder obtained from the experiment into a __zip__ file and uploaded it. However, **you are encouraged to convert your own benchmark data to the format regulated here!**. The supported data format is specified in [this page](https://iohprofiler.github.io/IOHanalyzer/data/). Please follow the instruction there to convert your data sets.
