This warning should now be resolved.

visualization options.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:
*   Package size exceeds 5mb (on some systems). 
Because of the large scope of the package, we have been unable to resolve this, 
and would like to request acceptance is spite of being slightly too large.
