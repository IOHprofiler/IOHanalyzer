\method{subset}{DataSetList}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The DataSetList}

\item{...}{The conditions to filter on. Can be any expression which assigns True or False
to a DataSet object, such as DIM == 625 or funcId == 2. Usage of && and || is only supported on default attributes 
(funcId, algId, DIM), not on combinations of with other attributes (e.g. instance). In those cases, & and | should 
be used respectively. Alternatively, this can be used as a keyword argument named 'text', with the condition as a 
string to be parsed. This allows exectution of subset commands on arbitrary variables in code.}

subset(dsl, instance == 1, funcId == 1) # Comma-seperated conditions are treated as AND
