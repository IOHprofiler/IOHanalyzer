\title{Verify that the credentials for DSCtool have been set}
\usage{
check_dsc_configured()
}
\description{
This uses the keyring package to store and load credentials. 
If the keyring package does not exists, it will default to look for
a config-file in the 'repository'-folder, under your home directory.
This can be changed by setting the option IOHprofiler.config_dir
If you already have an account, please call `set_DSC_credentials`
with the corresponding username and password. 
If you don't have an account, you can register for one using `register_DSC`
