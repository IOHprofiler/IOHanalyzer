\title{Glicko2 raning of algorithms}
\usage{
glicko2_ranking(dsl, nr_rounds = 100, which = "by_FV",
  target_dt = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dsl}{The DataSetList, can contain multiple functions and dimensions, but should have the
same algorithms for all of them}

\item{nr_rounds}{The number of rounds to run. More rounds leads to a more accurate ranking.}

\item{which}{Whether to use fixed-target ('by_FV') or fixed-budget ('by_RT') perspective}

\item{target_dt}{Custom data.table target value to use. When NULL, this is selected automatically.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the glicko2-ratings and some additional info
}
\description{
This procedure ranks algorithms based on a glicko2-procedure.
Every round (total nr_rounds), for every function and dimension of the datasetlist,
each pair of algorithms competes. This competition samples a random runtime for the
provided target (defaults to best achieved target). Whichever algorithm has the lower
runtime wins the game. Then, from these games, the glicko2-rating is determined.
}
\examples{
glicko2_ranking(dsl, nr_round = 25)
glicko2_ranking(dsl, nr_round = 25, which = 'by_RT')
