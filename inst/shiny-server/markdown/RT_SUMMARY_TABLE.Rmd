This table summarizes for each algorithm and each target value chosen on the left:

  * runs: the number of runs that have found at least one solution of the required target quality $f(x)$, 
  * mean: the average number of function evaluations needed to find a solution of function value at least $f(x)$
  * median, $2\%, 5\%,\ldots,98\%$ : the quantiles of these first-hitting times

When not all runs managed to find the target value, the statistics hold only for those runs that did. That is, the mean value is the mean of the successful runs. Same for the quantiles. An alternative version with simulated restarts is currently in preparation.
